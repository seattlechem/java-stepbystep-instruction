# Step 8 Instruction
## Create login / welcome controller
- login page provides input boxes for (1) userName and (2) password
- upon clicking submit button, userName and password are validated
- if validation passes, it routes to welcome page where it greets user with name
- if validation fails, it reroutes back to login page and display error message in red (login failed. check userName or password).

## this is hard coded userName and password validation.
